# Architecture & Technology Choices

## Framework Comparison

### React
**Pros:**
- Component-based architecture promotes reusability
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Strong TypeScript support
- Excellent for complex, interactive UIs
- Rich set of third-party libraries

**Cons:**
- Steeper learning curve for beginners
- Requires additional libraries for routing, state management
- JSX can be polarizing
- Larger bundle size compared to some alternatives

### Vue
**Pros:**
- Gentle learning curve
- Flexible and lightweight
- Single-file components keep code organized
- Good documentation
- Smaller bundle size

**Cons:**
- Smaller community than React
- Fewer high-quality third-party libraries
- Less corporate backing
- TypeScript integration not as mature as React

### Plain HTML/JS
**Pros:**
- Fastest to start with no build step
- No framework-specific knowledge required
- Smallest possible bundle size
- Best performance for simple sites
- No framework lock-in

**Cons:**
- Harder to maintain as project grows
- No built-in state management
- More boilerplate code
- Manual DOM updates can be error-prone
- Less developer tooling

## Final Decision: TBD by 2025-06-15

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Performance**: How fast will the site load and run?
2. **Maintainability**: How easy will it be to maintain and update?
3. **Development Speed**: How quickly can features be developed?
4. **Scalability**: Will this work as the project grows?
5. **Team Skills**: What skills does the team have?

### Recommended Stack
Based on our requirements, we recommend:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4
- **Video Hosting**: Vimeo Pro or self-hosted with Cloudflare Stream

### Next Steps
1. Create a small proof of concept with the chosen stack
2. Test performance with real content
3. Get feedback from the team
4. Make final decision by 2025-06-15
